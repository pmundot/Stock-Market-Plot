The following project while fully workson 3 different files, has yet toreach its full patential. 

The end goal for this project is to have a fully developed webpage that can drop down multipe plots

For now there are the following files:
<dl>
    <dt>2 CSV files</dt>
        <dd>-All_Stocks.csv</dd>
        <dd>-NYSE.csv<dd>
    <dt>Finding_Stock_Exchange.py</dt>
    <dt>finace_interact.py</dt>
    <dt>finance.py</dt>
    <dt>cs.html</dt>
</dl>

The following files work with eachother and do the following functions:

Everything isdone from command prompt

<b>Finding_Stock_Exchange.py and All_Stocks.csv</b>
<dl>
    <dt>use these two to find the stock exchange of your choice</dt>
    <dt>enter full stock exchange name Ex: New York Stock Exchange</dt>
    <dt>This will then scrape for all companies in that stock exchange as well as symbols</dt>
    <dt>it will then create a CSV of all companies and symbols for you to use</dt>
    <dt>This process may take some time as some exchanges have a lot of companies</dt>
</dl>

<b>finace_interact.py and NYSE.csv</b>
<dl>
    <dt>If you have multiple stock exchange csvs, this will find them in the same folder as file finance_interact.py</dt>
    <dt>NYSE.csv is a given stock exchange for the file for a person to use</dt>
    <dt>Will look for csv stock exchanges then look for desired company symbol wanted</dt>
</dl>

<b>finance.py and cs.html</b>
<dl>
    <dt>enter symbol and the code produces cs.html with company information</dt>
</dl>
